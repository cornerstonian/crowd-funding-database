Create the database
You are going to make a database to store data for your crowd-funding platform. The platform needs to have projects, users, and pledges.

Create a schema based on the following information:

A project has a title, a category, a funding goal, a start date, and an end date. Valid categories are: music, books, charity.

A user has a name and an age

A pledge has an amount. It belongs to a user, and it also belongs to a project.

Insert some records into the datbase

Create 10 projects, 20 users, and 30 pledges.
